This program was created by Kevin Klions for the purposes of an Object Oriented
Programming class.  The idea is to recreate the 2048 game.  Obviously, the
original idea for the game is not mine.  This program is for educational
purposes only, and is not to be distributed for profit. 

The program currently has the full algorithms implemented.  However the
GUI is very simplistic, and the program cannot be interacted with by the user
currently. User input (to actually play the game) and hopefully more
appealing graphics are things I plan to add in the future.

If you would like to run this game, there is an included .jar file found in 
classes/artifacts/2048
