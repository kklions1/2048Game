This program was created by Kevin Klions for the purposes of an Object Oriented
Programming class.  The idea is to recreate the 2048 game.  Obviously, the
original idea for the game is not mine.  This program is for educational
purposes only, and is not to be distributed for profit. 

Currently, The overall data structure of the game has been implemented.
It relies on a 2D grid of Square objects.
The game then prints a grid of 0s, takes an input, does nothing, then ends.

If you would like to run this game, simply run main.java in src/kevin
