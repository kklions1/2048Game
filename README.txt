This program was created by Kevin Klions for the purposes of an Object Oriented
Programming class.  The idea is to recreate the 2048 game.  Obviously, the
original idea for the game is not mine.  This program is for educational
purposes only, and is not to be distributed for profit.

If you would like to run this game, there is an included .jar file found in 
classes/artifacts/2048
